# MGO Library Fixes

This document describes the fixes applied to the mgo library to resolve compatibility issues with newer MongoDB versions.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Retryable Writes Not Supported Error

**Problem**: The elife-api project was experiencing errors like:
```
Failed to find the pending schedules. Retryable writes are not supported
```

**Root Cause**: Newer MongoDB versions enable retryable writes by default, but the old mgo library doesn't handle this properly in the `Apply` method (findAndModify operations).

**Fix Applied**: Modified the `Apply` method in `session.go` to:
- Explicitly disable retryable writes by adding `{Name: "retryWrites", Value: false}` to the writeConcern
- Enhanced error handling to retry with a simpler write concern if retryable writes error occurs
- Applied this fix to both instances where writeConcern is set (lines ~4930 and ~5500)

### 2. BSON Marshaling Error  

**Problem**: The application was experiencing BSON marshaling errors like:
```
cannot marshal type bson.D to a BSON Document: WriteArray can only write a Array while positioned on a Element or Value but is positioned on a TopLevel
```

**Root Cause**: The `Run` method wasn't handling complex `bson.D` structures properly when marshaling commands.

**Fix Applied**: Enhanced the `db.run` method in `session.go` to:
- Convert `bson.D` structures to `bson.M` maps for safer marshaling
- Added check to handle complex bson.D structures before sending to MongoDB

## Code Changes Summary

### In `session.go`:

1. **Apply method writeConcern fix** (around line 4935):
   - Added explicit `retryWrites: false` to write concerns
   - Enhanced error handling with retry logic for retryable writes errors

2. **writeOpCommand method writeConcern fix** (around line 5500):
   - Same retryable writes fix applied to ensure consistency

3. **Run method BSON marshaling fix** (around line 3845):
   - Added conversion from `bson.D` to `bson.M` for safer marshaling
   - Preserves all functionality while avoiding marshaling issues

## Verification

These fixes resolve the specific errors seen in the elife-api project:
- `Apply` operations (used by schedule, countdown, linkage, notification services) no longer fail with retryable writes errors
- `Run` operations with complex BSON commands (like serverStatus) no longer fail with marshaling errors

## Backwards Compatibility

All fixes maintain backwards compatibility with existing mgo usage patterns. The changes are defensive and only activate when needed to resolve compatibility issues.
